# Expo Managed Workflow: Obscure Native Module Access Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-diagnose, error in Expo's managed workflow.  The error arises when attempting to access native modules or functionalities not fully supported within the managed workflow environment.  The error messages themselves are often misleading, making debugging challenging.

## Reproducing the Issue

The `expoBug.js` file contains code that attempts to access a native module (simulated in this example).  Running this code within an Expo managed workflow app will result in an obscure error, often unrelated to the actual problem.

## Solution

The `expoBugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code. The solution might involve one of the following:

* **Using Expo modules:** Replace native modules with their Expo equivalents if available.
* **Ejecting from Expo:** If compatibility is impossible, consider ejecting from the managed workflow to the bare workflow to gain full control over native modules.
* **Correct Configuration:**  Verify if necessary configurations are set correctly in `app.json` or `eas.json`.
* **Expo Go Limitations:** If using Expo Go, remember it has certain limitations on accessing native modules.  Test on a real device or emulator.
